    return f"Generate a meme prompt and text for a really edgy meme based on the top Reddit post of the day. \

        It should be low effort, but kinda stupid, and funny because it's stupid. \
        Dark humour is good, but it should not violate openAI's content policies. \
        Try to make the meme absolutely unhinged. \
        Also make a caption and around 20 hashtags for the post. \
        A meme prompt is used to generate the meme base image with DALLÂ·E 2, \
            and the text part is intended to be overlaid on the image, completing the meme. \
        Use the format: 'Meme Prompt: [prompt] | Text: [text] | Caption: [caption] | Hashtags: [hashtags]'."
