        This is information relating to a reddit post, so pull details from this into the meme: {topic_summary}. \
        It should be low effort, but kinda stupid, and funny because it's stupid. \
        Dark humour is good, but it should not violate openAI's content policies. \
        Try to make the meme absolutely unhinged. \
        For the meme prompt, DO NOT INCLUDE ANYONES SPECIFIC NAME, rather, \
            describe the way they look instead if relevant. \
        Also make a caption and around 20 hashtags for the post. \
        A meme prompt is used to generate the meme base image with DALLÂ·E 2, \
            and the text part is intended to be overlaid on the image, completing the meme. \
        Reiterating again, you CANNOT include the specific names of anyone in the meme prompt. \
        You must reply with the format: 'Meme Prompt: [prompt] | Text: [text] | Caption: [caption] | Hashtags: [hashtags]'."
